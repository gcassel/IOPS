# IO Landing Page

## Introductory

### Mission

_What is the_ [_primary_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) __ [_goal_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) _which_ [_defines_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) _your_ [_project_](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md)_?  Mission should be identifiable as action in which the project either maintains or changes one or more resources of interest to the project stewards and others.  Mission may be perceived as vision, purpose, intent or goal.)_

_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

_IO's Mission:_ To provide templates, guidelines and standard operating procedures (or recipes) for _inclusively, methodically and scalably_ developing all types of _projects, collectives and networks_, including distributed computing networks.

### Storyline/ how it connects to nature

_**(Should we rename this as Vision? )** Tell us a story about the world in which your project has successfully performed or completed its mission._

The central concept of IO is that we can develop inclusive organizing activities and structures consistently and efficiently by methodically developing IO’s four _levels of design_: _inclusive language, activity, governance,_ and _distributive networking_. Shared languages are seen as the basis of all inclusive activities. Inclusive activities-- that is, _inclusive discussion, design and decision--_ are seen as the source of inclusive governance processes, which can lead to distributive networking which intentionally distributes governance authority, as well as other shareable resources. Projects can develop policies and policy design tools at any of these four levels in any order. This author believes that we will need to develop awareness and support of the full “four level stack” to develop inclusively at the unlimited scales and complexities which we will ultimately need in order to harness humanity’s collective wisdom potentials, and to sustainably survive and thrive as a species in reciprocal relations with others. However, IO is named in the plural (“Systems”) to emphasize its pluralism, and the diverse potential pathways to formal developments within the general community (and, when applicable, technical networks) of each project.

### Problem / Solution

_Can you describe your Project's Mission as the story of a key Problem and its Solution?_

Problem: The core problem perceived here is centralized bureaucracies which gather political and/or economic power, and externalize the costs of their activities to ecosystems, workers and consumers. \\

The solution: IO prioritizes low-tech practices which don’t depend on any highly specialized software or tech platforms, but can be directly integrated with many platforms and systems. \\

IO as a whole is represented by a visual diagram and directory:

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IOdiagram.png" alt="" data-size="original">\\

This diagram represents four _technical stacks:_

1. _levels of design_
2. _developmental frameworks_ which support those _levels of design_
3. _social relationships_
4. _digital networking_ which can improve the efficiency and scalability of organizing activities

The central concept of IO is that we can develop inclusive organizing activities and structures, including any or all of the four technical staks, consistently and efficiently by _methodically practicing_ IO’s four _levels of design_: _inclusive language, activity, governance,_ and _distributive networking_. Shared languages are seen as the basis of all inclusive activities. Inclusive activities-- that is, _inclusive discussion, design and decision--_ are seen as the source of inclusive governance processes, which can lead to distributive networking which intentionally distributes governance authority, as well as other shareable resources. Projects can develop policies and policy design tools at any of these four levels in any order. This author believes that we will need to develop awareness and support of the full “four level stack” to develop inclusively at the unlimited scales and complexities which we will ultimately need in order to harness humanity’s collective wisdom potentials, and to sustainably survive and thrive as a species in reciprocal relations with others. However, IO is named in the plural (“Systems”) to emphasize its pluralism, and the diverse potential pathways to formal developments within the general community (and, when applicable, technical networks) of each project.

The heart of IO is its _Developmental Framework Stack_ which is a framework of other models and recipes for the inclusive development of projects, networks and digital media resources. Each of IO’s component frameworks can provide any or all of the project’s constitutional policies and _policy design tools_ at each level of design, facilitating the development of inclusively distributive[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/distributive-networking.md)activities on increasing scales of magnitude and complexity. [**CMML**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sQGDXBpM9X\_FOmsEsA69CvuD9iuKtGAi0NXy9ba0gdI/edit#heading=h.hkdj6mlvdrk0) and [**Collective Resource Description Framework**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sQGDXBpM9X\_FOmsEsA69CvuD9iuKtGAi0NXy9ba0gdI/edit#heading=h.cqh15rqntkkd) (CRDF) is the culmination of the Developmental Framework Stack in IO. CRDF is meant to facilitate deeply distributive digital networking, and the[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/P2P.md)peer-to-peer development of[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md)effectively[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md)networked _collective digital media_[ \_\_ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)_resources_, including[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/database.md)distributed databases,[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/discussion.md)discussion[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/forum.md)forums and[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md)persistent[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md)communications[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/channel.md)channels

IO also has a _Social Stack_ which represents relationships between the primary types of agents and resources which the Organizational Development Stack can serve and support. For example, projects develop both governed and ungoverned participant roles (including voting membership roles) which may use or modify the project’s media resources and, when applicable, the physical resources which they represent. It’s especially important for key participants to support one or more media channels for collectively-supported interactions, including the use and updating of constitutional policies and policy design tools. Channels may include any number of digital formats as well as meeting and event programs. Projects may develop a number of official media channels while also actively supporting other, related channels, including ones which are either ungoverned or are governed by different people and groups. All of these media channels can be methodically networked to improve navigability and efficiency of usage, per [Collective Communications Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1\_KwMbdghVVv1FODuy21QsXXXHsAKTLGc0YGT64oh0mg/edit#heading=h.54681qu4rgu) and other developmental frameworks.\
\
IO also depicts a _Digital Networking Stack_ which represents hardware and software components which work together to run applications. IO specifically represents dapps (distributed applications) because (1) they require special networking techniques, and (2) this author believes that they’re crucial to developing massively inclusive and scalable global projects which govern and host many media items, including their own policies and policy design tools.

#### How IO Compares to Analogous Projects

Compared to many projects which are centrally developed in a unitary fashion, IO is an intentionally generic set of patterns and recipes for inclusively developing agreements and organizations in a variety of methodical, step-by-step options. It's a framework for developing agreements and organizations in all social contexts: within groups, between groups, between individuals and groups, and peer-to-peer. It’s a framework for developing exploratory discussion and media-sharing networks, as well as work agreements and[ ](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/commitment)economic commitments.

### Product(Goods/ Services)

IO consists of several dozen open source “developmental framework” modules including recipes and templates for developing projects and networks. These modules are being moved into this Gitbook collection. The modules can be used separately and/or together. Some of them are closely linked to each other-- even requiring cross-reference in some cases. Others are only indirectly related, but can serve one or more of IO’s four levels of design in the same project or network.

A dedicated Issues Log is a long-term goal for when IO has more contributors and creative attention; however, the Task Tracker and Work Log (see below) include Issues.

_**NOTE: Should we ask for all CC-related Issues to be submitted in Baserow, via a clear scope of mission (i.e. only indicate the issues which you need help with??)**_

The author is seeking co-authors of all modules, at a very low level of commitment, to directly approve any officially co-signed/ multisignature editions. Also interested in co-stewardship of specific modules and/or IO (or a version of it) itself, although this would be a much bigger commitment.

### Current Value Invested

_Describe or link the resources already invested in the project, including estimated person-hours of labor._

_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__

The author hasn’t used time tracking for most of IO’s development. Including all of the modules which were begun in 2015, the irregular IO work constitutes a mean average of about 20-40 hours of direct work per week for 86 months, or 1720- 3440 hours so far.

Task and time tracking have been somewhat more consistent since November 2021.

## Additional Media Resources

_Please link additional media resources which are officially associated with the project.  This should ideally include all public project media resources, and may include any private resources which you want to share in our network._

## Overview

**Inclusive Organizing Systems** (IO) is a network of modularly-linked open source recipes and frameworks for _inclusively, methodically and scalably_ developing all types of _projects, collectives and networks_, including distributed computing networks. IO prioritizes low-tech practices which don’t depend on any highly specialized software or tech platforms, but can be directly integrated with many platforms and systems.

\\

IO is represented by a [visual diagram and directory](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-WFMRYdueSBba1atcohX0G585zj-gBNlBvZQBqnEmEs/edit?usp=sharing) which depicts four _technical stacks_:

\\

1. _levels of design_
2. _developmental frameworks_ which support the _levels of design_
3. _social relationships_
4. _digital networking_ which can improve the efficiency and scalability of organizing activities

The core problem perceived here is centralized bureaucracies which gather power and externalize the costs of their activities. \\

The central concept of IO is that we can develop inclusive organizing activities and structures consistently and efficiently by methodically developing IO’s four _levels of design_: _inclusive language, activity, governance,_ and _distributive networking_. Shared languages are seen as the basis of all inclusive activities. Inclusive activities-- that is, _inclusive discussion, design and decision--_ are seen as the source of inclusive governance processes, which can lead to distributive networking which intentionally distributes governance authority, as well as other shareable resources. Projects can develop policies and policy design tools at any of these four levels in any order. This author believes that we will need to develop awareness and support of the full “four level stack” to develop inclusively at the unlimited scales and complexities which we will ultimately need in order to harness humanity’s collective wisdom potentials, and to sustainably survive and thrive as a species in reciprocal relations with others. However, IO is named in the plural (“Systems”) to emphasize its pluralism, and the diverse potential pathways to formal developments within the general community (and, when applicable, technical networks) of each project.\\

The heart of IO is its _Developmental Framework Stack_ which is a framework of other models and recipes for the inclusive development of projects, networks and digital media resources.

CRDF is meant to facilitate deeply distributive digital networking, and the[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/P2P.md)peer-to-peer development of[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md)effectively[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md)networked _collective digital media_[ \_\_ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)_resources_, including[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/database.md)distributed databases,[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/discussion.md)discussion[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/forum.md)forums and[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md)persistent[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md)communications[ ](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/channel.md)channels\\

## CMML

[Collective Media Markup Language](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H55a5TncjaXhyBi9Bf-Uwslce5\_FRhOY3BUk5t1rbRg/edit?usp=sharing) (CMML): CMML provides a framework for developing socially important metadata regarding specific media items and selected elements within those items. Such media markup languages can facilitate the development, stewardship and curation of richly informative collective media directories, repositories and wikis, greatly enhancing the networking and navigability of related data. They can provide root grammars, or pattern languages, for developing highly distributive and modularized digital networking, including technical integrations between different tech systems and stacks.\\

* [**Covalence**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uo4N-D3y3mhRx6kGTDpkDg7t5kS0AAYqz5\_aIKDG6sk/edit?usp=sharing) \*\*\*\* Covalence can be used as a feedback and rating tool. Collective covalence is a method of developing a lossless and highly informative social graph.

\\

## Modular Organizing

**Modular Organizing** serves as the main practical gateway to using Inclusive Organizing.

## How to engage

IO has been developed and open sourced by [Greg S. Cassel](https://github.com/gcassel). Greg seeks co-authors for all of the IO components. IO is represented by [a visual diagram and directory](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-WFMRYdueSBba1atcohX0G585zj-gBNlBvZQBqnEmEs/edit?usp=sharing), and is verbally described in [Guide to Inclusive Organizing Systems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1\_KwMbdghVVv1FODuy21QsXXXHsAKTLGc0YGT64oh0mg/edit?usp=sharing). IO has been designed to be used in self-directed activity; also, Greg is available on request to consult on IO usage and adaptation, including a free session for any seriously inquiring person or project. \\

**Highlighted IO Components:**\\

[Modular Organizing Recipe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ssWfsuaKQkytdW1q83qKzEjxrY-BoreREch46JOMQY/edit?usp=sharing) (MOR): MOR’s purpose is to facilitate inclusive, accessible collaborative development of [governance resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance-resource.md) and the links between them, through interactions which are mediated by natural language and simple, generic tools and techniques, thereby enabling people to inclusively develop projects and organizations at all scales of size and complexity. **MOR is meant to be the most direct and methodical way to begin using the IO resources.** \\
