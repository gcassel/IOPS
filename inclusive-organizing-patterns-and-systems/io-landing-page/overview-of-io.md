### Preface&#x20;

#### Purpose&#x20;

**Inclusive Organizing Systems (IO)** is a network of modularly-linked open source recipes, models and templates for _inclusively, methodically and scalably_ developing all types of projects, collectives and networks, including distributed computing networks. IO describes low-tech practices which don’t depend on any highly specialized software or tech platforms, but can be directly integrated with many platforms.

* _**add three or more examples at end of Purpose**_

#### Motivations&#x20;

I’m hoping to help all persons and groups to communicate and organize inclusively, methodically, consistently and efficiently, using tools and techniques which can be optimized for current conditions and responsively adjusted in the future.

I’m trying to maximize IO’s compatibility with handwritten and oral practices (which are often preferable, anyway, up to a certain scale of social complexity and magnitude).

IO can be used in countless ways, but it prioritizes inclusivity over freedom per se. I believe that inclusive organizing systems will deeply favor compassionate communities and commons building over the violent, confusing, coercive and deceptive forces which thrive in our globally dominant systems and institutions.

_<mark style="color:purple;">work in progress: integrate the following text from Peer-to-Peer Digital Networking: How the Internet Should Work below:</mark>_

_Many problems, both obvious and obscure, imperil our astonishing shared potentials. For example, we all face escalating systemic crises including wealth disparity, armed violence and burgeoning ecological stress. Many people recognize and discuss such problems._&#x20;

_We also face deep cultural obstacles to our community-building potential. Some people confront this. They fight dehumanizing propaganda, and focus on empathetic concepts including minority rights, social safety nets and nonviolent communication._&#x20;

_We also face deep problems in communications technology. A small but significant, growing number of people confront this. They work to improve the infrastructure, fairness and transparency of digital media applications and platforms, so that we can communicate and collaborate more effectively._&#x20;

_Some people work regularly on all of those fronts. However, people promote projects and organizations which they or their friends control. In many cases, creators legally ‘own’ and seek to profit from their projects — and from my perspective, all of those efforts seem to miss the deepest potentials of p2p networking, which no one could ever own or control._&#x20;

We can foster just and effective dialogue between tech and culture with these open tech goals:

1. All globally valuable communications software should be, or (eventually) become, freely available to diverse digital networks.
2. Network participants should be able to use any software which meets systemic specifications for protocols or APIs.
3. Projects and networks should foster inclusivity by supporting affordable and technically simple tools and techniques (including live in-person dialogue, for highly localized interactions!) whenever appropriate, both in their standard operating procedures and especially as emergency backups in case of disruptions of technical interdependencies.

I want and need feedback on IO! I’d especially appreciate if feedback reflects these framing questions:

1. **Does this technology create or enhance an ability for people to communicate or organize?**
2. **If this technology restricts an ability to communicate or organize, should that be a technical limitation or a social standard?**

### Formal Context&#x20;

IO links many developmental models, recipes and related concepts together in a suggested sequence of developmental stages for highly complex, adaptive, massively scalable collectives and networks. Each of the related frameworks which seems sufficiently developed for responsible, unassisted use and adaptation is open-sourced via Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The author further intends to eventually put some highly generic works into the public domain using a non-attributive license.

The genesis of IO and its linked frameworks depended on the development of the pragmatically skeptical philosophy described in Dialogic Holism.

### Overview&#x20;

IO is represented by a visual diagram and directory which depicts four technical stacks:

1. _levels of design_&#x20;
2. _developmental frameworks_ which support _the levels of design_&#x20;
3. _social relationships_&#x20;
4. _digital networking_ which can improve _the efficiency and scalability of organizing activities_

The unifying concept of IO is that we can develop inclusive organizing activities and structures consistently and efficiently by methodically developing IO’s four levels of design: inclusive language, activity, governance, and distributive networking. Shared languages are seen as the basis of all inclusive activities. Inclusive activities-- that is, inclusive discussion, design and decision-- are seen as the source of inclusive governance processes, which can lead to distributive networking which intentionally distributes governance authority, as well as other shareable resources. Projects can develop policies and policy design tools at any of these four levels in any order. This author believes that we will need to develop awareness and support of the full “four level stack” to develop inclusively at the unlimited scales and complexities which we will ultimately need in order to harness humanity’s collective wisdom potentials, and to sustainably survive and thrive as a species in reciprocal relations with others. However, IO is named in the plural (“Systems”) to emphasize its pluralism, and the diverse potential pathways to formal developments within the general community (and, when applicable, technical networks) of each project.

The heart of IO is its Organizational Development Stack which is a framework of other models and recipes for the inclusive development of projects, networks and digital media resources. Each of IO’s component frameworks can provide any or all of the project’s constitutional policies and policy design tools at each level of design, facilitating the development of inclusively distributive activities on increasing scales of magnitude and complexity.

IO also has a Social Stack which represents relationships between the primary types of agents and resources which the Organizational Development Stack can serve and support. For example, projects develop both governed and ungoverned participant roles (including voting membership roles) which may use or modify the project’s media resources and, when applicable, the physical resources which they represent. It’s especially important for key participants to support one or more media channels for collectively-supported interactions, including the use and updating of constitutional policies and policy design tools. Channels may include any number of digital formats as well as meeting and event programs. Projects may develop a number of official media channels while also actively supporting other, related channels, including ones which are either ungoverned or are governed by different people and groups. All of these media channels can be methodically networked to improve navigability and efficiency of usage, per [Collective Communications Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1\_KwMbdghVVv1FODuy21QsXXXHsAKTLGc0YGT64oh0mg/edit#heading=h.54681qu4rgu) and other developmental frameworks.

IO also depicts a Digital Networking Stack which represents hardware and software components which work together to run applications. IO specifically represents dapps (distributed applications) because (1) they require special networking techniques, and (2) this author believes that they’re crucial to developing massively inclusive and scalable global projects which govern and host many media items, including their own policies and policy design tools.

## 1. Shared Languages&#x20;

### Introduction&#x20;

_WIP: add an introduction here describing the value of shared verbal and visual languages within any intensely cooperative or collaborative context, as a basis for inclusive activity, governance and networking._

You can have some inclusive activities without a shared language, but they can’t scale in complexity.

The vast majority of our intellectual and emotional capacities can be explored through oral language. Written language, although it has many limitations, helps to massively scale activities across vast distances, times, and numbers of participants.

* specify basic requirements of shared verbal languages&#x20;
* “micro-summarize” the costs and benefits of written language versus oral, based on the related sections of Developing P2P Networking and Nonlinear Dialogue: Part One&#x20;
* describe the need for consistent media naming and formatting, including a checklist of desirable standardizations&#x20;
* specify basic requirements of shared visual languages, including representation of parallel and sequential processes and different link-types.&#x20;
* mention MOT, MNF and ARA (below) as efforts to fulfill these perceived needs. briefly indicate their intended relationships to each other.

### Modular Organizing Terminology&#x20;

[Modular Organizing Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology) (MOT) is a basic terminology for modularly specified organizing, design and governance technologies. I intend for MOT to facilitate useful communication, coordination and collaboration in diverse social contexts without requiring potentially noisy complexity or specificity. For example, agents can use these terms to develop resources including models, plans and reports, and to propose agreements. This terminology can also facilitate the peer-to-peer development of non-coercive open standards and recipes. further summarize and explain the reason for MOT note that here (and elsewhere in IO) the underlined (but not hyperlinked) terms have MOT definitions. note that MOT is just one (English!) open source vocabulary & should be at least “partially forked” (customized and extended) for varied purposes

### Naming and Formatting Protocol&#x20;

Naming and Formatting Protocol (NFP) is a naming and formatting protocol for all types of digital media items and folders. The purposes of NFP are:

To improve the legibility and navigability of media drives, folders and items. To make it easier to consistently and efficiently write, read, update and integrate potentially varying versions of documents into collective activities.

further summarize NFP note that naming and formatting protocols such as MNFP are only important for large (or indefinitely expanding) media collections; therefore, MNFP use may begin much later than many other components of IO it’s just one example of a consistent media naming and formatting protocol note MNF’s special relationship to the Collective Drive Structure in Collective Communications Framework

### Describing Resources and Systems&#x20;

Describing Resources and Systems (DRS) is a tool for modeling, designing and describing all types of resources and systems. This document can be used in many ways. It serves as a primary support document for Modular Organizing Recipe and, by extension, the rest of Inclusive Organizing Frameworks.

### ARA Visual Language Framework&#x20;

ARA Visual Language (ARA) functions as a generic visual modeling and mapping system for diverse types of perceived and desired relationships between agents, resources and actions. ARA is meant to help diverse activists, organizers, designers and engineers to accurately model and map all important actions and activities which they individually or collectively: perceive to have happened, or be happening predict or otherwise expect want to happen support or (when applicable) directly perform ARA is further meant to facilitate the identification of underappreciated strengths, weaknesses, potentials and risks of perceived, predicted, wanted and/or supported actions. For example, one key potential of ARA modeling and mapping is to highlight any confusion or conflict between different agents' expectations, desires and commitments. further summarize ARA This summary should function as a minimum viable product for deciphering IO and linked diagrams.

## 2. Inclusive Activities&#x20;

### Introduction&#x20;

develop an introduction here describing the basic need for inclusive activities, design and resource support

Inclusive activities depend upon inclusive language to develop the typical levels of complexity, including extended sequential processes, in many typical human activities. (However they can develop in simple forms without any language at all.)

Inclusive activities enable deeply inclusive governance and networking. describe how inclusive activities can and should develop before governance, and Inclusive Governance can enter the picture whenever governance is needed include an overview of the basic relationship between IMEF, RSF and IAF (below)

### Modular Organizing Recipe&#x20;

Modular Organizing Recipe (MOR) is designed to serve as the primary system for developing and governing all projects and all tasks within a specific organizational context, including personal and collective projects.

MOR prioritizes direct and reasonably clear, simple relationships and interactions which don’t depend on any highly specialized software or software services, nor on complicated and potentially confusing policies or rules which could protect personal or subgroup preferences at great cost to a project, collective or community.

MOR offers a basic framework for developing and tracking projects and tasks via a small system of hyperlinked text documents and spreadsheets. Each goal can be designed and tracked by defining a Project, including its purpose and any important stages of development, sub-projects and tasks, and assigning Roles and Events as needed to the Project and its components. Projects, Roles and Events each have perspectives (and views/ user interfaces) within MOR, and can be developed from any of those perspectives. MOR’s many potential integrations with other IO components enable additional perspectives centered on persons, collectives, and other resources.

MOR is based on the action-based MOT philosophy of analyzing projects and tasks according to an unlimited number of potential stages and levels of organizing, including any number of parallel processes and serial processes in each Project or task. MOR recommends increasing the formal level of detail of each Project only on an as-needed basis, with careful cost/benefit analysis of added complexities, aiming to help people to prevent and to resolve serious risks, stresses and conflicts while improving the effectiveness and efficiency of goal-oriented efforts.

### Social Support Framework Social&#x20;

Support Framework (SSF) is a general framework for developing and managing personal and social issues, including all types of questions, concerns and problems. SSF is based on moving through four recursive, overlapping cycles of personal process, inclusive dialogue, inclusive action and social support systems. These cycles can often produce collective media resources.

SSF links closely with IAF. further summarize SSF

### Inclusive Development Framework&#x20;

Inclusive Development Framework (IAF) is a collaboration framework which suggests a standardized process for inclusively developing resources and producing specific actions. IAF’s major component, 3D Development Recipe, is especially focused on developing products-- including goods, services, shared activities and events, or any combinations thereof-- which require substantial sharing of personal resources, including attention and work.

### Inclusive Meeting and Event Framework&#x20;

Inclusive Meeting and Event Framework (IMEF) is a developmental framework for hosting and facilitating any type of event which intentionally includes many co-creative peers in the event design process. IMEF is especially intended for events, including meetings, which are designed by their participants.

## 3. Inclusive Governance&#x20;

### Introduction&#x20;

add an introduction here describing the basic need for inclusive and distributive governance-- based on shared languages and inclusive activities, and empowering distributive networking.

derive some of the intro from Inclusive Governance Premises introduce CBG, ICP, DGF, DSR and CMNF (below). overview of their basic relationships. indicate general types of important resources to collectivize, such as plans, programs and reports

We all need to get better at making hard decisions individually & collectively. Otherwise, those decisions will keep on being made by people who don't care (much) about our interests, don't experience such hardship, and optimize hard-heartedly per privileged biases.

### Consent-Based Governance Policy and Principles&#x20;

Consent-Based Governance Policy and Principles (CBG) is a framework of principles and basic policies for developing purely consent-based written agreements and collectives/ organizations. CBG is a radical evolution of anarchism theory, meant to scale for a digitally networked world.

CBG provides key principles for Inclusive Channel Policy and Distributive Governance Framework.

### Inclusive Channel Policy&#x20;

Inclusive Channel Policy (ICP) is a minimum viable policy for governing an independent media channel. ICP can also function as the root organizing kernel for complex collectives and media networks. In such social contexts, the governing agents of the parent group should coordinate ICP’s Admissions standards with any other relevant policies, including any constitutional documents.

further summarize ICP as a keystone for developing sustainably inclusive media channels and networks

### Distributive Governance Framework&#x20;

Distributive Governance Framework (DGF) builds on Inclusive Channel Policy's consent-based organizing kernel by adding collective levels of organizing and systemic functions. DGF includes a root Guest/Contributor/Member/Steward participation framework which is meant to facilitate consent-based governance of large collectives and their media networks. DGF further suggests basic general/personal/governance channels for each network’s primary topic, and the development of any desired number of specialized channels and personal roles. DGF-based networks can link organizing components, including channels and roles, either p2p or hierarchically. DGF-based networks can also develop modular, federated and distributed versioning relationships between components, either within specific collectives or across larger networks.

DGF can serve to develop the basic rights and responsibilities needed for a large group to inclusively develop a collective media network framework. (See Collective Communications Framework.)

Decision-Making Flowchart Decision Flowchart is a decision-making tool for individuals, teams and collectives, meant to help people distinguish as quickly & easily as possible between Minor Decisions, Standard Decisions, and Unapproved/Emergency Decisions.

summarize Decision Flowchart further, including its links to Design Guide, Advice Protocol and Design Board

Design Board summarize Design Board as a basic approach to developing ideas within any specific project or collective

Developing Specialized Roles Developing Specialized Roles and Positions (DSR) is a developmental framework which suggests a set of activities and standards for inclusively and equitably developing specialized roles in our teams, collectives and shared activities.

further summarize DSR

Collective Communications Framework summarize Collective Communications Framework (at a low level of detail, because it’s big)

CCF is a developmental framework for collectives of any size which want to build inclusive, effective and efficient communications systems. CCF is modularly built to support options for General Communications Policies, Supported Channels, Messaging Policies, Additional Policy Types, Media Management, Website, Database, Wiki and Technical Support Systems.

Also summarize this key CCF component: Version Sync Protocol

1. Distributive Networking Introduction add an introduction here describing the general potentials of distributive networking-- based on shared languages, inclusive activities and governance

Distributive Networking Framework summarize and link Distributive Networking Framework, including brief descriptions of its following components:

Distributive Networking Framework (DNF), suggests how media channels, collectives and networks can be officially related to each other through many levels of design to inclusively distribute collectively-governed resources.

Developing Links Add a short intro here describing links and their organizing functions.

P2P Links Describe the basic nature of p2p semantic links, interfaces and relationships between nodes.

Modular Links Definition: A module is a component which can be replaced by any valid alternative in a specific systemic context.

Modular links are defined by specifications and by collective support of specifications.

Compound Links -- start with this specialized definition for compound description, which must be adapted to link design and network design:

Compound description is description which describes an element by assigning a set of potentially variable traits to it.

Alliance Summarize and link Alliance from DGF

Go beyond DGF’s implications for coalition.

Distributed Versioning summarize an updated version of Distributed Versioning from Distributive Networking

Collective Media Markup Language summarize and link Collective Media Markup Language

Collective Resource Description Framework summarize and link Collective Resource Description Framework (from github and/or Distributive Networking)

Distributing Databases summarize and link Distributive Databases from Distributive Networking

Definition: A distributed database has the traits of ownership, authority and editing (etc; review this) which are distributed among autonomous agents.

Transitioning to a Distributed Database Primary directory becomes a distributed network database instead of website Collective website= superstructure/extension of the database. The website should auto-sync any officially authorized & relevant changes from the database Note: It's also possible to enable official changes to occur first at the website instead of the directory; however, this is only feasible if media updating and syncing practices are quite consistent, and resiliently distributed. Note how a distributed database creates inter-agent networking of networks

1. Systematic Examples WIP:\
   include the one generic example from P2PDN Verbal Overview, and three or more other specific examples. eventually, link reported real uses

use thought exercise examples of how complex networks (each with one specific goal) could develop through this framework of frameworks sequentially increase complexity in each example illustrate most aspects of Distributive Governance Framework in at least one example include at least one hierarchical and federated relationship in each example depict modularity and distributed version control in at least one example include distributed database in the final example

Current generic example from P2PDN:

The following description provides a high level overview of recommended p2p elements, forms and processes for developing massively inclusive and scalable collectives and networks: Receive/Send Authorization People socially organize as digital identities which authorize each other to receive data from and (sometimes) send data to specific signal channels, using secure p2p signaling standards for both streaming and messaging. View/Edit Authorization People simultaneously organize as viewers and editors of data storage addresses and storage locations. Storage location editors distribute viewing and editing rights to develop collective media resource items. This enables the development of complex networks of specialized addresses, including forums, which have collectively-specified participation roles such as Guests, Contributors, Members and Stewards. (See Distributive Governance Framework.) Collective RDFs People use inclusive design, annotation and evaluation to further develop collective media resources via portable and dynamically updated resource description frameworks (RDFs), which globally map public and private resource addresses via international resource identifiers (IRIs). Dynamically updated RDFs enable (a) community-defined differentiation of media resources using modular, composite and hierarchical organizing forms, and (b) flexible user-defined sorting, filtering and searching of media resources. Distributed Computing Collectives develop p2p distributed computing to make each of its community-supported and portably-described media resources independent of all specific storage devices and data servers. People link distributively-hosted collective media resources to intercollective distributed versioning systems, and relate their media more indirectly and organically to other media via associative hyperlinks and semantically linked data, including media attributes and evaluations by participants in officially related collectives.
